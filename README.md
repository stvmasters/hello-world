Getting started with GitHub

## This is new
Trying some Markdown code as well because it's not *enough* to learn just **one thing at a time**.

### Edits, revisited
[This should be a link to ESPN.com; note that it requires full path formatting with `http://` in order to work](http://espn.go.com)

This should be an unordered list:
* This is mic no. 1.
* This is mic no. 1.
* Isn't this a lot of fun.

Ordering:

1. Lather
2. Rinse
  1. Check whether hair is clean; if so, skip 3.
3. Repeat

Aha -- Ordered List requires an extra line of space between label/explainer and start of list for some reason.

> You can fool some of the people some of the time, and half of the people all of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time. I think Abraham Lincoln said that. You can be in my dream if I can be in your dream. I said that.
